					ASSIGNMENT 1 REPORT
				      	     --------

1. Algorithms used in colour processing chain:
   1.1 CFA Interpolation :
	Bilinear Interpolation is implemented.
   1.2 Colour Correction : 
	To correct R,G,B of each pixel in the rgbImage array produced from previous processing step
	(CFA Interpolation). An matrix which was optimised for the CMOS image sensor is multiplied by 
	each element (a vector) in the rgbImage array and produced a new vector with corrected R,G,B.
   1.3 Gamma Correction : 
	A look-up table is built in the programme. The table maps 8-bit values to 8-bit values. 
	The table entries are calculated using gamma = 0.5 and transfer function (((1/255)^gamma)*255.
	R,G,B of each element in the rgbImage array from previous steps are corrected using the 
	look-up table.
2. Image quality
   The output image quality is fairly good. However, it has blurring effect and some black areas are actually
   not in black colour.
3. Conclusion
   The programme has been successfully implemented the colour processing chain with three steps CFAInterpolation, 
   Colour Correction and Gamma Correction to convert a CFA image to true color RGB image.
